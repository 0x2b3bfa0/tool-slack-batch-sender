Thank you for filling out the HE #skill-software-devops skill survey.
I am reaching out to everyone who filled out the survey, recruiting folks to
fill out several core teams. In particular, we are looking for folks who
have experience with any of the major cloud platforms - AWS, Azure and GCP -
to staff up teams to provide guidance to project teams. We are also looking
to staff up several project liaison teams. These teams will act as the
interface between the core cloud platform teams and the project teams.
Finally, we are looking for volunteers to help with security infrastructure
as well as project architecture review efforts.

If you haven't already join one of the many HE efforts and you are still
looking to get involved with HE devops, please take a minute and respond
to this message. I'd like to know if you can join one of the teams I outline
above. In particular, we are likely to have plenty of AWS expertise - over
half of the survey responders indicated AWS experience - so we are asking
folks to help ensure we have a balance of expertise across the teams.

Thanks again for volunteering for Helpful Engineering's devops channel!
